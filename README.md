# Key features
# React
- Component-Based Architecture: React allows you to build encapsulated components that manage their own state and compose them to make complex UIs. Components can be reused, making your codebase more maintainable.

- Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to enhance performance. When the state of an object changes, React updates the virtual DOM first, then it compares this virtual DOM with the actual DOM and updates only the parts that have changed.

- JSX (JavaScript XML): JSX is a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript. It makes the code easier to read and write.

- State and Props: React uses state and props to manage data within components. State is used for managing data that changes over time, while props are used for passing data from one component to another.

- Lifecycle Methods: React components come with several lifecycle methods (like componentDidMount, shouldComponentUpdate, etc.) that allow you to control what happens during the different phases of a component's life.

- Hooks: React hooks (like useState, useEffect, etc.) allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. They simplify the code and make it easier to reuse stateful logic between components.

- Unidirectional Data Flow: In React, data flows in one direction (from parent to child). This makes it easier to debug and understand how data changes in your application.

# Firebase
- Real-time Database: Firebase provides a real-time NoSQL database where data is stored as JSON and synchronized in real-time to every connected client.

- Authentication: Firebase Authentication makes it easy to integrate secure sign-in methods into your app, including email/password, phone authentication, and federated identity providers like Google, Facebook, and Twitter.

- Firestore: Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud Platform. It helps you store and sync data for client- and server-side development.

- Hosting: Firebase Hosting provides fast, secure, and reliable hosting for your web app. It supports static files, dynamic content, and serves your app over a global CDN.

- Cloud Functions: Firebase Cloud Functions let you run backend code in response to events triggered by Firebase features and HTTPS requests. They are fully managed and auto-scale.

- Analytics: Firebase provides detailed analytics to measure user engagement and activity across your app. You can track custom events, user properties, and much more.

- Cloud Messaging: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) allows you to send notifications and messages to users across different platforms. It supports both notification messages and data messages.
